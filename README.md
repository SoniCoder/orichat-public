Public Endpoint for OriChat

The app itself has no restrictions to use, however depending on which backend the users want to communicate, they may need to provide apiKey in some cases through the settings button.

The usual settings are:
protocol: 'https',
host: 'api.openai.com',
port: '',
apiKey: '',

The users are free to choose their own host and port but if they wish to use openai servers as the backend, they will need to provide their own apiKey which they can get through:
https://platform.openai.com/playground
